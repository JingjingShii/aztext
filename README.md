Azure Text Analytics
====================

This package provides a quick introduction to the pre-built Text
Analytics models provided through Azure's Cognitive Services. This
service extracts information from text that we supply to it. Such
information includes the language, key phrases, sentiment (0-1 as
negative to positive sentiment), and entities (person, organisation, a
quantity, date and time, a URL, or an email address).

A free Azure subscription is available from
https://azure.microsoft.com/free/. Once set up visit
https://ms.portal.azure.com and Create a resource under AI and Machine
Learning called Text Analytics. Once created you can access the web
API subscription key from the portal. This will be prompted for in the
demo.

Please note that this is a *Closed Source* cloud-based API accessible
offering with a free tier of some 5000 transactions per month. If this
service demonstrates value then pricing begins from $2 per 1,000 text
records, reducing with volume.
